# StringMultiplier
Java-based number multiplication using ONLY Strings. No numbers are used (or even typed) in the code, at all.

A self-imposed rule bans the use of any ints/floats/doubles/etc, and even chars. These types are forbidden from the source code, as well as from any Java functionality that would otherwise return those types.

__Warning:__ This is awful. It was written for a small code challenge, and was over-designed to be an extremely-inefficient joke. It was my first crack at it, and I only had a day to finish. It's really ugly.

Running this with really large numbers will certainly take a long time, and may even overflow the heap. Have fun. I'm going to go bleach my eyes.
